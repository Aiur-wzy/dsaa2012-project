Project Proposal Requirements Summary
- Goal: minimal, real-time facial expression recognition system using a lightweight CNN trained on FER-2013.
- Pipeline: OpenCV-based face detection and alignment, per-frame emotion inference, and deployable prototype balancing accuracy, latency, and portability.
- Validation: reproducible training pipeline with live camera evaluation of robustness and fairness in real-world settings.
- Research questions:
  RQ1: Can a lightweight CNN achieve robust FER-2013 accuracy without large backbones?
  RQ2: Which augmentations and loss designs mitigate label noise and class confusion?
  RQ3: How stable is performance across illumination, pose, and demographic proxies, and what biases emerge?
- Context: addresses label noise and distribution shift in FER-2013, targeting end-to-end approach with robustness-oriented training and deployment optimization.
